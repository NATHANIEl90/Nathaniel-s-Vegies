            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p class="par">We decided to open just one store outlet in Sta.Cruz – Zambales in order to test run the business for a period of 3 to 6 years to know if we will invest more money, expand the business and then open other outlets in Zambales.

                We are quite aware that there are a several vegetable retail stores and of course several supermarket and grocery stores all over Sta.Cruz – Zambales and even in the same location where we intend locating ours who also engage in the retailing of fresh vegetables, which is why we are following the due process of establishing a new business.</p>
